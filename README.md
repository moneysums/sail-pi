# sail-pi

Sailing timer for the Raspberry Pi

## Getting started

You need a working Raspberry Pi running Raspbian (tested with Buster) with the following:
* Raspbian with desktop software (the full 'desktop and recommended software' distribution is not
  required and will slow down updates)
* working internet connection
* HDMI display
* mouse
* terminal connection through a keyboard or SSH (only required for installing sail-pi)

Open a terminal on the Pi.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moneysums/sail-pi.git
cd sail-pi
bash ./scripts/install.sh
```

```bash
bash ./scripts/install-dev.sh
```
